# BadAppleCS
A C# console code that plays the Bad Apple video.

PLEASE unzip the pics rar file to its location, it must look something like this "Bad Apple\bin\Debug\pics" and inside pics, there must be 5451 really low-res .jpg files. Total size of the folder with all the pictures inside should be around 6.61 MB. After that you can delete the rar file, open and run the code.

Also note that some console properties like resizing are not available anymore in Windows 11, so the codeline "Console.SetWindowSize(81, 30);" will not work.
